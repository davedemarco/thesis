From Joe's thesis: 

SM:
- Standard model, its predictions vs parameters
- Lagrangian formalism background information, equations of motion
- Noether's theorem on symmetries as a tool for physics
- differentiating local and global symmetries
- gauge theory and local transformations
- quantum field theory as an example of Lagrangian formalism
- gauge theories and re-normalizability
- renormalization and eliminating infinite integrals
- group generators, hermitian conjugation, hermitian matrices
- U(1) sufficient to describe leptonic EM
- massless gauge bosons required in theory, but W and Z are massive!
- need uncoupled LH and RH helicity fermions for gauge invariance, but parity is violated!
- Hence...spontaneous symmetry breaking
- vacuum expectation value and field written as fluctuations about the vev
- covariant derivative definition and usage
- EW unification?
- field strength tensors
- Goldstone bosons absorbed as degrees of freedom
- combinations of components of gauge fields give physical fields
- weak mixing angle
- Yukawa coupling and fermion masses

Phenomenology:
- protons in collisions, valence and sea quarks
- momentum transfer, hard scatter, soft interactions
- pertubative vs. non-pertubative QCD
- factorization and renormalization scales
- parton showering
- hadronization
- parton distribution functions
- hard scatter cross sections
- Higgs production modes
- Feynman diagrams, XS measurements
- Theory uncertainties
- higher-order radiative corrections
- pdfs and acceptance efficiences
- underlying event
- Higgs decay modes, mass dependance
- branching ratios
- narrow width approximation
