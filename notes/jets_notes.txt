From Joe's thesis: 

- composite objects
- can reconstruct jets from multiple constituent sources (focus on calorimeter energy deposits)
- combine energy cells into topological clusters
- Jet-finding algorithms
       - infared safety (soft particles affecting jet number)
       - collinear safety
       - detector tech (in)dependence
       - minimising effect on spatial/energy resolution
       - luminosity stability
       - calibration ease of use
       - efficient computing resource use
- kt, anti-kt and cambridge-aachen algs
- uses for jet types
